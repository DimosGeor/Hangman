## Classes Description

- **Dictionary**:  
  Contains the list of words and returns a random word for the game.

- **Game**:  
  Contains the core game logic including guessing letters, tracking progress, checking win/loss conditions, and managing tries.

- **Menu**:  
  Displays the main menu, handles user input for starting new games, showing statistics, or exiting the application.

- **Main**:

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK installed (version 8 or later)

### Compile
```bash
javac *.java


## Gameplay Instructions

- When the program starts, a menu appears with these options:  
  - Start a new Game (N)  
  - Statistics (S)  
  - Exit (E)

- Choose **N** to start a new game.

- The word to guess is shown as a series of dashes (`-`), each dash representing a letter.

- You have **8 guesses** to figure out the word by guessing one letter at a time.

- Enter a letter (case-insensitive).  
  - If you enter a non-letter character, you will be prompted to enter a valid letter.

- After each guess:  
  - If the letter is in the word, the program reveals all occurrences of that letter.  
  - If the letter is not in the word, you lose one guess.

- The current progress of the word is displayed after every guess.

- If you guess all the letters before using up all tries, you win.

- If you use all 8 tries without guessing the word, you lose.

- After each game ends, you return to the main menu, where you can start a new game, view statistics, or exit.
